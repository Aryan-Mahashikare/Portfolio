  							<p>Hello, I’m Aryan Mahashikare, a first-year Computer Science Engineering student at ADCET who loves to learn how things work and create cool stuff through code. I’m always exploring new technologies and improving my skills with small projects. This portfolio is my first step toward growing as a developer.</p>

								<h2 class="major">SWOT</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/SWOT1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses. Speaking of my strengths, my English speaking skills are good. Another strength is determination, whenever I decide to do or learn something, I will do my best to finish it quickly and properly. I also understand things quickly, which helps me to learn more things in less time.</p>
								<p>I also recognize the weaknesses I have, my biggest weakness is procrastination, I a lot of the times feel like I can manage the work later but it doesn't happen. Another weakness would be my communication skills and stage fear. I hesitate to talk with new people or speak in front of a crowd. These weaknesses will definitely affect my growth but I will give my best to overcome these weaknesses. </p>
								<p>Opportunities don’t always come back once missed, so I’ve learned to stay attentive of these opportunities and make the most of them. Nowadays, finding new opportunities has become a lot easier due to internet. There are various online courses and contests I can take part in and improve my skills. Taking these opportunities at the right time can really help me in achieving my goals.</p>
								<p>The threat I have is that nowadays, because of online platforms, education has become much more accessible and competition is increasing every day. Social media also acts as a big distraction. Every minute I spend getting distracted takes me away from what I’m supposed to do, and in that time someone else might move ahead of me. So, I need to stay focused and keep working hard, as my biggest threat is the people I’m competing with for my career.</p>
